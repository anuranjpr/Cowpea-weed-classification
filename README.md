# cowpea-weed-Classification

## Purpose of dataset creation
‘Cowpea-weed-Classification’ is created to address real-time weed challenges and encourage weed research using computer vision applications.

## About the dataset
‘Cowpea-weed-Classification’ is a crop-weed research dataset with 2439 data samples, which can be used for image classification. Cowpea samplings (Class 0), Grasses (Class 1), and Broad-leaf weeds (Class 2) are the three research objects focused during this data acquisition process.Data samples with class labels are provided herewith.

## Equipment used for data acquisition
To record a rich set of information on the research objects,the photos were taken using samsung s22 ultra.

## Data acquisition
This dataset emphasizes the early stages of crop growth to meet the challenges faced during the ‘Critical period of weed competition’.

## Expected outcome
The expected outcome of this dataset will be an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model that predicts the correct class of a particular data sample.
